How to add bath solution?

How to add neuromodulator data to bath? Keeping in mind it may only go to part of the prep when a vasoline well is used

DATA MISSING:

745_090 does not appear to have its data
774_084 - data missing

745_028 - pyn_y is an unknown channel (does it go to crab A (1) or B (2) ? )

774_79 - apparently two temperatures? maybe different parts of the well are at different temperatures?



774_009 - channels not labeled, need to know mapping


I don't understand IN 2 IN 3 records
