WHAT WORKS NOW
--------------
✓ Core session, document, element, probe operations
✓ All DAQ readers (Blackrock, CED Spike2, Intan, NDR, SpikeGadgets)
✓ All ontology lookups
✓ Complete cloud sync and publishing
✓ Basic database operations
✓ Time management and time series
✓ Basic calculator framework
✓ Dataset management

WHAT'S MISSING
--------------
✗ Specialized element types (timeseries, neuron)
✗ Advanced epoch management
✗ All spike sorting/extraction apps
✗ Database metadata management (critical for publishing)
✗ Most GUI components
✗ Pipeline management
✗ Lab-specific setup scripts
✗ Many utility functions

PYTHON ADVANTAGES
-----------------

CONCLUSION
----------
The ndi-python port successfully implements core NDI functionality for basic
neuroscience data management, DAQ reading, and cloud operations. However,
significant work remains to achieve feature parity with MATLAB, particularly
in specialized analysis tools, metadata management, and GUI components.

The port is production-ready for:
- Basic session/document/element operations
- Reading data from all supported DAQ systems
- Cloud sync and dataset publishing (without rich metadata)
- Ontology lookups and validation
- Simple custom calculators

Additional porting needed for:
- Advanced analysis (spike sorting, orientation tuning, etc.)
- Rich metadata management
- Pipeline workflows
- GUI-based operations
- Lab-specific data conversions
